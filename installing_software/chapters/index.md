# Overview

Learn how to install and manage open-source software packages for research
computing. Installing software is often tricky due project-specific
requirements for package versions---which can conflict with other
projects---and inconsistent or incomplete install documentation. We’ll focus on
using [pixi][], a package manager for [the conda ecosystem][conda-eco], to
create independent, reproducible software environments and install software
with ease. We’ll also briefly discuss the unique advantages of using pixi for
Python projects and how pixi compares to other package managers.
