# Overview {-}

![](img/datalab-logo-full-color-rgb.png)

Learn and practice how to talk directly to your computer via the command line. 
The Unix shell is a powerful tool for using scientific software, working with 
large datasets, and controlling remote servers. It is primarily used to manage 
files and run programs, and it allows for automation of repetitive tasks. This 
workshop is a prerequisite for many of DataLab's workshops, including 
Introduction to Version Control with Git, Reproducible Research for Teams with 
GitHub, and the Remote Computing series.
