While we've only scratched the surface of what you can do on the command line,
the commands and underlying concepts we've discussed here will prepare you to
adapt to new ways of using CLIs. With this, our hope is that you'll become a
more confident and experienced computer user. If questions do arise, DataLab
offers support across all levels of experience, and we are happy to field
questions during our office hours. You can find out more information about them
[here][]. Happy scripting!
