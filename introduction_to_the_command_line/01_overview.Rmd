Preliminaries
=============

This workshop covers the basics of using the Unix command line interface. It is 
a **hybrid workshop**. First, independently work through this online tutorial at 
your own pace. Next, join us for the live interactive session (details below), 
during which we will learn to interact with the files and file structures of our 
computers in new ways.
