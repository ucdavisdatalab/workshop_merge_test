Working with the Command Line
=============================

Most people interact with their computer through a graphical user interface, or 
GUI, which allows them to use a mouse, keyboard, and graphical elements on screen 
(such as file menus, pictures of folders and files, etc.) as they do their work. 
We tend to conflate our operating systems and their GUIs because computer 
hardware and software manufacturers tightly pack these two things together as a 
convenience to users. But the operating system that makes your computer work 
(Windows 10, Mac Big Sur, etc.) and the GUI that you interact with are, in fact, 
completely different and separable software packages; it is possible to use 
different methods/software to interact with your computer than the stock GUI that 
launches automatically when you turn it on.

On such method is the "command line" interface. The command line offers a 
text-only, non-graphical means of interacting with your computer, acting somewhat 
like a typewriter (rather than a *window* or *desktop*, as the prevailing 
metaphors for GUIs go). In the early days of computing, all user interaction with 
your computer happened at the command line. But during the 1980s, computer 
manufacturers---with Apple at the lead---made a big push to convert their machines 
to the windowing systems we know today. The command line, they felt, was too 
difficult for users to understand and this, in turn, would hamper computer sales.

Nowadays, there are few viable (and at present, almost no commercially available) 
GUIs that can compete with the predominant systems of Macs and PCs. While this is 
not the case for Linux machines, people are by and large locked into the GUIs that 
come pre-installed on their machines. Command line interfaces are, however, 
available, and some are even still installed on popular computer hardware.

Using these interfaces require you to launch a special program.
 
**Mac users** will use an application called "Terminal," which ships by default 
on macOS. To launch Terminal, go to:

> Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal

When you launch the application, you will see something like this:

**Windows** users will use an application called PROGRAM. Instructions for 
installing this program are on the previous page.

To launch PROGRAM, go to:

> Click on the Windows Start Menu and search for "PROGRAM"

Alternatively,

> Click on the Windows Start Menu, select Programs, and browse to PROGRAM

When you launch the application, you will see something like this:

The Anatomy of the Command Line
-------------------------------

While the command line can look intimidating to those raised on a GUI, using 
it is actually quite simple. Instead of pointing and clicking on things to make 
them happen, you type in your commands.

Let's return to the window that opens when you start Terminal or [PROGRAM].

![](img/prompt.png)

Here, we see the command line **prompt**. You'll enter your commands here. But 
before doing so, let's point out some valuable information contained within 
the prompt itself. The beginning of the line, `tshoe@ds`, tells us the current 
user (`tshoe`) and current computer (`ds`). This may seem redundant, but with the 
command line it is possible to interact with remote computers via a network, so 
it's helpful to have this information displayed as a reference point.

The bit of information after the colon (in this example, the `~` character) tells 
us where in the computer's filesystem we are. We'll discuss this later. For now, 
just keep in mind that you can look here to find your current location. In this 
case, `~` means you are in your **home** directory.

![](img/prompt_home_highlight.png)

After the location, we see the `$` character. It is an indicator that lets you 
know the command line application is waiting for you to enter something. (Note 
that you do not need to type this character, it will appear automatically, but 
the examples below include it to emulate what you'll see onscreen)

Depending on your system and/or command line interface, you may or may not also 
see a solid or flashing box that appears after the prompt character. This is a 
**cursor position indicator** and it tells you where the current cursor is in 
the terminal. This is useful if you need to go back and correct and error. 
Generally speaking, you can't click around with a mouse in this kind of interface. 
Instead, you'll use your computer's `Left` and `Right` arrows to move the cursor 
to the correct location and make any changes from there.

Interacting with the Command Line
---------------------------------

As noted earlier, we interact with the command line by typing in our commands. 
For example:

```
$ echo
```


...will print back to screen any text that you supply to the command. It literally 
echoes your text:

```
$ echo "Hello world!"
Hello world!
$
```

To execute this, or any command, you simply hit the `Return`/`Enter` key on your 
keyboard. You'll see that when you execute a command, the system will perform the 
indicated operation, print any output from that operation to screen, and deliver 
a new command line prompt.

Note that depending on your particular system and/or command line interface, 
things might look slightly different on your computer. However, the basic 
presentation and function as described above will be the same.

Command Syntax
--------------

The syntax of commands is relatively straightforward. Commands use a space to 
delimit their different components, and you can add optional **flags** to modify 
how a command runs (more on these flags below). When put together, these 
components look like so:

```
$ [command] [optional flags] [file, data, or other pointer on which to run the command]
```

There is one caveat to this: because commands use spaces to delimit their 
components, you can run into problems when running commands on files with spaces 
in their names. Your command line interface program will interpret that file's 
spaces as separate components and an error will almost surely result. If you're 
running a command on a file with a space in its name, you'll need to **escape** 
that space with `\`.

This will throw an error:

```
$ [command] file name.txt
```

This will not:

```
$ [command] file\ name.txt
```

Stopping a Command
------------------

Did you do something that causes your computer to print a million lines on screen? 
Did you decide you don't want that file copied to a new location, and it's still 
in the midst of transferring? You can **interrupt** any command with `CTRL+C`. 
This will stop whatever current process is running in your interface.

While you can stop a command, for the most part *it isn't possible to undo a 
command*. Please take care to know exactly what you're running and what you're 
running it on, especially when it comes to modifying or deleting things on your 
computer.

Common Command Line Commands
----------------------------

During our hands-on workshop session we will practice using several commands. 
Be prepared to have this page ready as a reference during class to make things 
easier.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
command <- c("ls", "ls -l", "ls -a", "pwd", "mkdir", "cd", "mv", "cp", "rm", "man")
command_fullname <- c(
  "List",
  "List with Long flag",
  "List with All flag",
  "Print Working Directory",
  "Make Directory",
  "Change Directory",
  "Move",
  "Copy",
  "Remove/delete",
  "Manual")
explanation <- c(
  "Lists all files in the current directory.", 
  "Lists additional information about each file.",
  "Lists all files, including hidden files.",
  "Prints the current working directory.",
  "Creates a new file directory.",
  "Navigates to another directory on the file system.",
  "Moves files.",
  "Copies files.",
  "Deletes files.",
  "Opens the manual page for another command.")

command_table <- data.frame(
  `Command`=command, 
  `Command Name`=command_fullname,
  `Function`=explanation,
  check.names=F)
knitr::kable(command_table[,], caption = "")
```
