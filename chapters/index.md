Overview
========

A research project is **reproducible** if a different researcher can carry out
the same analysis with the same data and produce the same overall result. To do
so, they need transparent, detailed documentation about _all_ of the steps in
the research process and access to the tools---especially code---with which the
steps were carried out. Reproducibility enables independent verification, a
touchstone for all research.

There are myriad practices, often accompanied by software tools, that can help
ensure research projects are reproducible. This overview workshop will help you
decipher which to adopt and when to adopt them. The workshop also highlights
additional benefits many of these practices confer, such as making it easier to
collaborate with others. As an overview, this workshop is relatively
non-technical, but provides technical references, including other DataLab
workshops, for all of the practices covered.


Learning Goals
--------------

After completing this workshop, learners should be able to:

+ Describe widely-used practices and tools for ensuring that research projects
  are reproducible, such as:
     - Writing documentation
     - File and directory naming conventions
     - Version control systems
     - Software environment management
     - Build systems
     - Packaging
     - Software testing
     - Virtualization and containerization
+ Explain the advantages and disadvantages of these reproducibility practices
+ Evaluate whether a given reproducibility practice is relevant to their
  research project
+ Identify references they can consult to learn technical details about
  reproducibility practices
+ Explain the ways in which reproducibility practices can facilitate
  collaboration for active research projects


Prerequisites
-------------

This workshop is intended for learners of at all experience levels, and may
benefit learners at different experience levels in different ways. There are no
prerequisites and no prior programming experience is necessary.
