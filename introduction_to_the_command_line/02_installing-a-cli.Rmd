Installing a Command Line Interface
===================================

The following instructions are for **Windows users only**. Mac and Linux both 
come pre-installed with Unix-ready command line interfaces, whereas Windows 
does not. Interested to know why? [This article][] offers a nice overview of the 
history of different operating systems.

Windows Subsystem for Linux
---------------------------

If you're on Windows, you'll need to enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux 
(WSL) and install Ubuntu, which is available through the Windows Store. 
WSL/Ubuntu provides a small, Linux-based operating system on your computer, 
which gives you a full-featured Linux environment that can interact with your 
normal files.

Enabling the Windows Subsystem for Linux
----------------------------------------

The DataLab has a short, 10-minute tutorial on setting up a WSL on a Windows 
computer. It walks through some brief configuration options and then shows you 
how to get Ubuntu. You can find this tutorial at the [DataLab Install Guides page][]. 
Under "1. Command Line Tools," you'll want to skip down to 1.2: "Linux Subsystem 
for Windows (Ubuntu)."

If you are not able to successfully install the WSL on your own machine, please 
attend DataLabâ€™s Virtual Office Hours. Click [here][] for more information and to
