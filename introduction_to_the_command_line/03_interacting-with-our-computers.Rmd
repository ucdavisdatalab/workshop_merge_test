Interacting with Our Computers: A Very Brief Primer

Most people interact with their computer through a graphical user interface, or 
GUI, which allows them to use a mouse, keyboard, and graphical elements on screen 
(such as file menus, pictures of folders and files, etc.) as they do their work. 
We tend to conflate our operating systems and their GUIs because computer 
hardware and software manufacturers tightly pack these two things together as a 
convenience to users. But the operating system that makes your computer work 
(Windows 10, Mac Big Sur, etc.) and the GUI that you interact with are, in fact, 
completely different and separable software packages. It is possible to use 
different methods/software, or **shells**, to interact with your computer other 
than the stock GUI that launches automatically when you turn it on.

On such method is the "command line" interface (CLI). The command line offers a 
text-only, non-graphical means of interacting with your computer, acting somewhat 
like a typewriter (rather than a *window* or *desktop*, as the prevailing 
metaphors for GUIs go). In the early days of computing, all user interaction with 
your computer happened at the command line. But during the 1980s, computer 
manufacturers---with Apple at the lead---made a big push to convert their machines 
to the windowing systems we know today. A CLI, they felt, was too difficult for 
to understand and this, in turn, would hamper computer sales.

Nowadays there are few viable (and at present, almost no commercially available) 
shells that can compete with the predominant systems of Macs and PCs. While this 
is less the case for Linux machines, people are by and large locked into the GUIs 
that come pre-installed on their machines. CLIs are, however, available, and 
some are even installed on popular computer hardware.

To the Command Line: A Mentality Shift
--------------------------------------

The following sections will discuss how to open and use CLIs. Doing so is 
necessarily action-oriented: the workshop covers a host of different commands 
that will help you in your day-to-day work on a computer. But knowing the 
pragmatics of using a CLI is only one part of a broader change in the mentality 
we bring to interacting with our computers beyond the GUI. When we work on the 
command line, we find ourselves doing things computers typically _do for us_. 
Because of this, we need to know more about how our computers work than we 
would if we only used a GUI.

This workshop only covers a small part of that knowledge, but the commands and 
conventions we'll discuss tend to generalize to other activities like writing 
code or tracking files with version control. Learning this material, then, is in 
part about preparing yourself to learn more advanced computing skills later on. 
As such, this workshop -- and with it, our live session -- will cover broader 
concepts and conventions in computing as much as it will show you how to use 
the command line.
