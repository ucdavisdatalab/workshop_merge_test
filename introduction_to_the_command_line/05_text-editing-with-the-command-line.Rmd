Text Editing with the Command Line
==================================

Beyond the basic commands and navigation functions we've discussed so far, the 
command line also features the ability to edit files directly, usually by means 
of a text editor. These editors are similar in nature to Microsoft Word or Mac 
Pages but they're much more stripped down and tend to work best with plain text 
files (`.txt` files, code files like `.R` or `.py`, etc.). These editors are only 
accessible from the command line and it is important to know how to use them so 
that you can open, read, and write directly in the command line window.

Accessing Command Line Text Editors
-----------------------------------

Macs and [PROGRAM] both ship with a text editor called **Vim** (other common 
editors include Emacs and Nano). To open a file with vim, type `vi` in a 
command line window, followed by the filen ame. If you want to create a new 
file, simply type the filen ame you'd like to use for that file after `vi`.

Vim works a bit differently than other text editors and word processors. It has 
a number of 'modes,' which provide different forms of interaction with a file's 
data. We will focus on two modes, **Normal** mode and **Insert**. When you open 
a file with Vim, the program starts in Normal mode. This mode is command-based 
and, somewhat strangely, it doesn't let you insert text directly in the document 
(the reasons for this have to do with Vim's underlying design philosophy: we're 
more likely to edit text on the command line than we are to write it).

To insert text in your document, switch to Insert mode by pressing `i`. You can 
check whether you're in Insert mode by looking at the bottom left hand portion 
of the window, which should read `-- INSERT --`.

Once you are done inserting text, pressing `ESC` (the Escape key) will bring you 
back to Normal mode. From here, you can save and quit your file, though these 
actions differ from other text editors and word processors: saving and quitting 
with Vim works through a sequence of key commands (or chords), which you enter 
from Normal mode.

To save a file in Vim, make sure you are in Normal mode and then enter `:w`. Note 
the colon, which must be included.After you've entered this key sequence, in the 
bottom left hand corner of your window you should see "[filename] XL, XC written" 
(*L* stands for "lines" and *C* stands for "characters").

To quit Vim, enter `:q`. This should take you back to your command line and, if 
you have created a new file, you will now see that file in your window.

If you don't want to save the changes you've made in a file, you can toss them 
out by typing `:q!` in place of `:w` and then `:q`. Also, in Vim key sequences 
for save, quit, and hundreds of other commands can be chained together. For 
example, instead of separately inputting `:w` and `:q` to save and quit a file, 
you can use `:wq`, which will produce the same effect. There are dozens of base 
commands like this in Vim, and the program can be customized far beyond what 
you'll typically need for basic command line usage. More information about this 
text editor can be found [here](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vim_Tips_Wiki).

Basic Vim Commands
------------------

```{r, echo=FALSE}
vim_command <- c("esc", "i", ":w", ":q", ":q!")
vim_explanation <- c(
  "Enter Normal mode.", 
  "Enter Insert mdoe.",
  "Save.",
  "Quit.",
  "Quit without saving.")

vim_command_table <- data.frame(vim_command, vim_explanation)
colnames(vim_command_table) <- c("Command", "Function")
knitr::kable(vim_command_table[,], caption = "")
```
