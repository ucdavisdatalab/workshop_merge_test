# Overview {-}

![](`r url15`)

Learn and practice how to talk directly to your computer via the command line. The shell
is a very powerful tool for using scientific software and working with larget data sets. 
It is primarily used to manage files and run programs, and it allows for automation of 
repetitive tasks. This workshop is a prerequisite for DataLab's workshops on Introduction to
Version Control with Git and Reproducible Research for Teams with GitHub.
